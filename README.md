## Project: FILE SYSTEM IN ANDROID STUDIO

This repository contains two Android applications developed to demonstrate the principles of data storage, settings management, and handling external files in the Android operating system.

### Tasks Overview:
1. **Task 1**: Implement a sample network connection.
2. **Task 2**: Implement application codes (requests, interaction with the server via sockets).
3. **Task 3**: Develop a mobile application allowing users to asynchronously download journal files from a source (Scientific and Technical Bulletin or a similar file source).
4. **Task 4**: Store and read settings. Upon application startup, a semi-transparent popup notification should appear, providing brief instructions on how to use the application (you may write random text), along with a checkbox "Do not show again" and an "OK" button.

## Applications:
- **[SocketCommApp](./SocketCommApp)**: This application combines Tasks 1 and 2, demonstrating network connectivity and socket communication.
  
- **[JournalDownloader](./JournalDownloader)**: This application merges Tasks 3 and 4, enabling users to download journal files asynchronously and manage settings.

### Getting Started
To get started with either application, navigate to the corresponding folder and follow the setup instructions provided in their respective README files.
